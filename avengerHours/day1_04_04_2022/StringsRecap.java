    String: class, object type. sequence of chars.

    String class is a member of java.lang package. no need to import.

    there are 2 ways to create string objects
        1- String literal (mostly used)- String str="Apple";
            created in String pool in heap memory

        2- new keyword- String str2=new String ("Apple");
        created in heap directly

        ** both are same in terms of usage, but only different for memory allocation.

        String objects are immutable which means unmodifiable/unchangeable
        String a="Apple";// a new object is created in str pool in heap
        a="apple"; // a new obj is created in str heap, not
     */
}
